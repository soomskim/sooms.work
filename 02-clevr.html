            <p>The Collaborative Learning Experiences in Virtual Reality ⚛︎<a href="https://education.mit.edu/project/clevr/" target="_blank">CLEVR</a>⚛︎
                is an interactive educational two-player game that seeks to explore how cross/extended reality (XR) and game-based approaches can aid 
                in education; specifically in a highschool student's understanding of a cell. 
                <br><br>
                The game is played with two players - an explorer (VR) and a navigator (tablet). 
                The Explorer is virtually placed inside a 3D rendered cell, 
                and their partner, the Navigator, interacts with an informative tablet screen to help guide them.

            <p>As the sole UI Designer on the team, I was tasked with updating the tablet interface. 
                The challenge was to present all information and features without overwhelming the user.
